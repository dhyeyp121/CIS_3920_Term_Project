This project proposes to analyze the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Open Payments data to uncover the professions and popularity of doctors receiving payments from the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. By employing data mining techniques, we aim to contribute to the enhancement of transparency and accountability within the healthcare system. This analysis seeks to reveal the patterns, trends, and insights hidden in the data, potentially influencing healthcare practices and policy decisions.
